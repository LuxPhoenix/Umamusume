# Umamusume
This is a project aiming at automatically running the game of Umamusume Pretty Derby. 

# V0.1
For this early draft I just created a function control.start_game, which takes a bool parameter and will start the game from home screen of umamusume pretty derby international edition. If it takes zero, a new game is started. If the parameter is one, then it continues a previous save.

This version unfortunately only works on my macbook with screen size 2880 * 1864.

Popenv is a folder containing a virtual environment. To activate on mac, use terminal command:

source Popenv/bin/activate
