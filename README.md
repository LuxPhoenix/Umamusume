# Umamusume
This is a project aiming at automatically running the game of Umamusume Pretty Derby. 

# V0.1
For this early draft I just created a function control.start_game, which takes a bool parameter and will start the game from home screen of umamusume pretty derby international edition. If it takes zero, a new game is started. If the parameter is one, then it continues a previous save.

This version unfortunately only works on my macbook with screen size 2880 * 1864.

To run this code you need to install pyautogui, pillow, and OpenCV

On macbook I used iphone mirroring to connect to mobile device and then run this code. The window do have to be fixed to the top right corner of the macbook.

I know this code is insanely bad but trust me it is only starting.
